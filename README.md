### Earthquake Rupture Data Generation
This repository contains code for generating synthetic earthquake rupture data, as well as scripts and tools for working with and visualizing the generated data. The code is written in Python and is designed to be easily customizable and extensible.

#### Abstract
We introduce a new machine learning framework designed to help researchers who relys on simulations to study physical systems or processes. High computational costs and the resulting limited data often pose significant challenges to gaining insights into these systems or processes. In this innovative approach, we first train a supervised predictive model using a small-scale simulated dataset with varying input parameters. Subsequently, a deep learning generator is developed using the same data points. The final step involves training a reinforcement learning agent that employs the supervised model and generator to produce more accurate, simulation-like data. By leveraging this framework, researchers can generate more accurate data and know the outcomes without running high computational simulations. Which enabls them to explore the parameter space more efficiently and gain deeper insights into physical systems or processes. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework by applying it to two case studies in material science and geodynamics. We also discuss the potential applications of this framework in other fields, such as fluid dynamics, climate modeling, and drug discovery.

### Getting Started
To get started with using this code, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your system, along with several Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file. You can install these packages using the following command:

### Required libraries
Once you have the necessary packages installed, you can generate synthetic earthquake rupture data using the generate_data.py script. This script takes several parameters, including the number of ruptures to generate, the dimensions of the rupture area, and the magnitude range of the ruptures. For example, to generate 100 ruptures with dimensions of 100 x 100 km and magnitudes between 6.0 and 8.0, you can run the following command:

### Data
python plot_data.py data/rupture_0.csv
This will generate a plot of the rupture area and magnitude, which will be saved in the plots directory.

### Example Results
The following schematic diagram shows the framework:
